<h3>What is kubgen?</h3>
<p>Kubgen is a program that takes your text and turns it into a beautiful,
multi-colored square.</p>
<p>It has some interesting properties:
<ul>
<li><b>For identical text, the square will be identical.</b>
<blockquote>This means you can use the colored square as a digital
signature for your text.</blockquote></li>
<li><b>Any change, no matter how small, will completely change the
square</b>
<blockquote>This means even adding a space on the end of the text gives you
a completely different square</blockquote>
<li><b>The chance of getting the same pattern with two given texts is mind
bogglingly small</b>
<blockquote><ul><li>The number of combinations of colors for this square is 4 to
the power of 256, or
<div style="overflow: auto; width:600px">
13407807929942597099574024998205846127479365820592393377723561443721764030073546976801874298166903427690031858186486050853753882811946569946433649006084096</div>
</li>

<li>That number has 155 digits.</li><li>  To compare, the number of grains of sand on
all the earth's beaches is a number with less than 20 digits.</li>
<li>And there
are like 5 or ten stars in the universe for every grain of sand.  So that
number is bigger still then the number of grains of sand on earth, mars,
and every planet in the universe.</li><li>  Interestingly, there are more atoms in a
grain of sand then there are grains of sand on all the beaches or stars in
the universe.</li><li>  Finally, the number of atoms in the universe has at most 82
digits, the number above is still incomprehensibly bigger.
</li><li>As Douglas Adams may have put it, the odds of finding two identical
squares is about the same as the odds of dropping a ball bearing out of and
airplane and having it land on an egg sandwich.
</li><li>Yet opening a connection to your bank account uses numbers way
bigger.</li>
</ul></ul>
<h3>How exactly is this cube generated?</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you click "los!", the program takes the text in the box and uses
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-512</a> algorythm to
create a hash that is a 128 digit hexadecimal number.
<blockquote>For example, the text "blarg" produces the hash:
<div style="overflow: auto; width:600px">
10c561e815929839cf1e0dd88c6bfee23179a449f0c5529547d211f0ca2c1671ea1e485977b012d7679d73a8948bcfcebba5196f28fe38c929b216d5be667f1f</div>
</blockquote></li>
<li>each digit in this 128 digit hex number is converted to a two digit
base-4 number, or in other words, a pair of digits ranging over the four
values: 0,1,2 and 3
<blockquote>In the above number, the hex digit "1" is converted to "01",
the "c" (the hex digit for 12) is converted to "30"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>So now the hash is a 256 digit (base-4) number, consisting of digits
ranging from 0 to 3.  Each of thos four digits is mapped to a color, and
then the 156 colors are displayed in a 16x16 square.</li>
<blockquote>If you must know the above number in base 4 is:<br>
<br>
<div style="overflow: auto; width:600px">
0100301112013220011121022120032130330132003131202030122333323202030113212210102133003011110221111013310201013300302202300112130132220132102011211313230001023113121321311303222021102023303330322323221101211233022033320320302102212302011231112332121213330133</div>
<br>
<br>which in a nice 16x16 square is:<br><br>
0100301112013220<br>
0111210221200321<br>
3033013200313120<br>

which in colors looks like:
